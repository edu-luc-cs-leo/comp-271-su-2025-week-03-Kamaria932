## Reflection on Week-02 Assignment 

**What went well:**
The swap logic went mostly well. Child swaps with parent if the parent is larger. I have similar formats for referencing the nodes that need to be swapped or compared. My code compiles and it is neat, follows the programmers pact, and has a single return per method. My code includes a lot of comments. 

**What looks different:**
My code looks longer and complicated with trying to figure out with the parent and child should swap.In a way to identify the parent and child I use numbers which can be sometimes hard to understand from someone who does not know the assignment. Thus the swapping looks complicated and hard to follow along.


**Improvements:**
I wished I added a toString() method to avoid all the loops and complicated lines of code. Shortening the code based for readabillity and clear logic.


**Grade:**
My code compiles and pass the tests in the implementation file, but I think I struggled a lot with making sure the correct nodes were swapped and the best way to perform that swap wile having the current node become in the parents old position. I don't think it was a bad effort but I think this assignment is not A work. I also think my code follows the prompt and perferms the swap, however I think my code needed a lot of work for simplification. I would give my code a B- or B.
